Fair warning though that this game\nmay be on this list mostly because of nostalgia.\n\nOne aspect of this game that I really enjoy is the process of building your\nparty over time and making sure you train the right characters.

This is\noften fairly difficult - since the characters are weaker after all - which only\nadds to the satisfaction when you pull it off.\n\nAnother cool mechanic in FE is building supports between characters.  When two\ncharacters fight side by side they will over time build a relationship, which\nleads to little dialogue bites.  It's satisfying to discover these as you play\nthrough the game.\n\nBoth training weaker units and building supports are examples of\n'meta-challenges' in FE; they aren't required to finish the games, but give you\nself-directed and sometimes difficult optional objectives during the battles.\nBecause these challenges are self directed they make me feel like I am\nexpressing myself more as a player, which makes the game feel more interesting\nthan if I was just solving the same battle puzzles as everyone else.\"\n    [\"game\" \"solitary\" \"turn-based\" \"story\" \"\u2b50top10\"]\n    []]\n\n   [\"[XCOM 2 + War of the Chosen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCOM_2)\"\n    \"Very similar appeal to Fire Emblem.
